# Wallet Registry

## Entries

The contents of this directory, plus its subdirectories, represents wallet applications that support the [Mobile Wallet Adapter protocol](../spec/spec.md). Each file expresses details of a single wallet app. For the purposes of this registry, the same wallet on two different platforms should be expressed as two different entries. For e.g., if the "Foo Wallet" wallet application is available on both iOS and Android, a separate entry should be created for each.
